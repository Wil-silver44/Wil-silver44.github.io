            <p>
                Since I even before I began my studies at The University of West Florida, I have been enamored by technology. Sleek websites,
                powerful software, all of these complex systems have held sway in my mind for as long as I can remember, and I am commited to
                continuing to learn as much as I can about this varied field. When I am not working or studying however, I spend my time playing
                video games, listening to music, or cooking.
